Automating stuff my whole life, professionally since 2001. Got married, have two
kids, enjoy gaming and watching TV. The things I value in life (next to family):

* [Inclusivity](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/inclusive-speaker-orientation/) in presentations, messaging and other communications.
* [Netiquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_in_technology) (good behavior on the Internet)
* [BLUF (bottom line up front) communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication))
* Open and direct communication

Automating stuff my whole life, professionally since 2001. Got married, have two
kids, enjoy gaming and watching TV. The things I value online:

* [Inclusivity](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/inclusive-speaker-orientation/)
in presentations, messaging and other communications.
* Good behavior on the Internet
([netiquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_in_technology)).
* [Open and direct](https://nohello.net) communication
[BLUF (bottom line up front)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication))-style.

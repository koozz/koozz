Hi, I am Jan van den Berg. I'm a software developer living in the Netherlands. I enjoy comics like [xkcd](https://xkcd.com), reading [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/), watching movies (and series) and spending time with my wife, son and daughter.

As of July 2020 I'm working as a Site Reliability Engineer at Ahold Delhaize.

Before that, I have had the roles of:

            <summary>SDL Tridion</summary>
            <p>
            Started at Tridion by mavenizing the whole Content Delivery codebase,
            making it easier to modify or add a module to the codebase. Next to that
            I replaced the proprietary logging framework with a third-party logging
            framework which increased performance and migrated from JUnit 3 to JUnit 4.
            All of this work contributed to easy configuration of the Continuous
            Integration server and being able to show code quality metrics.
            </p>
            <p>
            While being the Certified Scrum Master for the Content Delivery team, I
            still contributed a lot of my time to development of the Content Delivery
            stack (transporting, deploying, storing, retrieving and rendering content).
            It was an interesting mix challenging code (concurrency, JPA, transactions)
            and interesting techniques (REST, OData, OAuth).

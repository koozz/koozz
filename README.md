Hi, I am Jan.

This is my user manual.

My style
--------
* I try to prevent my attention from being hijacked by technology. Notifications
are mostly turned off and I only check my email once or twice a day.
* I believe cooperation is achieved through synchronous communication and urgent
matters cannot be taken care of through email, WhatsApp or chat (unless actively
engaged).
* I strongly feel someone is and stays responsible for a task/situation until it
is accepted by someone else.
* I'm old-fashioned in email communication; To-recipients are active
participants of this asynchronous communication, where CC-recipients are only
passively informed.

What I value
------------
* I value resourcefulness and proactivity. Be smart, move fast and pivot
quickly.

What I don't have patience for
------------------------------
* If you make a mistake or something is heading off the rails, tell me before
the crash. Failure is great (as long as you learn quickly); surprises are not.
* I default to trust, but if my confidence is shaken, it's hard to rebuild. Ways
to lose my trust: withholding important information, being dishonest or treating
others with disrespect.

How to best communicate with me
-------------------------------
* Be crisp. Start with the headlines. I prefer bullet points to prose.
* I love to solve problems, remove barriers and help out others. I do prefer you
come to me not just with problems, but with plausible solutions and your
recommended course of action.
* I value authenticity, honesty and transparency. If I say something you
disagree with, tell me. I am hungry to be challenged in thoughtful and
constructive ways.

How to help me
--------------
* I can sometimes linger on the details or improve until perfection is reached.

What people misunderstand about me
----------------------------------
* I am an introvert, posing as a professional extrovert.
* I speak with conviction, but I'm not set in my thinking. I'm open-minded and
always delighted to be shown a better way.

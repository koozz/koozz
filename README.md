My user manual
==============

My goals
--------

* Make [BLUF (bottom line up front)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication))
  my default way of communication.
* Spend more time on open-source software.
* Respond to email within a week.
* Respond to DM a bit faster.
* Give you a call when I need you.

My pitfalls
-----------

* I used to dwell on details. Now I try to be direct and to the point. Not
everybody likes that.
* I get distracted quickly. I'll check my email in the morning and have turned
off most notifications.
* I default to trust, but if my confidence is shaken, it's hard to rebuild. Ways
to lose my trust: withholding important information, being dishonest or treating
others with disrespect.
* I am an introvert, always adapting to the less-introvert-minded world around
me. I might seem quiet, but my head is definitely working.

My beliefs
----------

* Autonomous teams and independent professionals can achieve more through
asynchronous communication than waisting time on meetings.
* Urgent matters cannot be taken care of through email, DMs or chat (unless
actively engaged).
* Someone is and stays responsible for a task or situation until it is actively
handed over.
* Email etiquette; To-recipients are active participants of this asynchronous
communication, where CC-recipients are only passively informed.

My team member
--------------

* I value resourcefulness and proactivity. Be smart, move fast and pivot
quickly.
* If you make a mistake or something is heading off the rails, tell me before
the crash. Failure is great (as long as you learn quickly); surprises are not.
* Be crisp. Start with the headlines. I prefer bullet points to prose.
* I love to solve problems, remove barriers and help out others. I do prefer you
come to me, not just with problems, but with plausible solutions and your
recommended course of action.
* I value authenticity, honesty and transparency. If I say something you
disagree with, tell me. I am hungry to be challenged in thoughtful and
constructive ways.

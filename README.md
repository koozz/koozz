Automating stuff my whole life, professionally since 2001.

Got married, have two kids, enjoy gaming and watching TV.

The things I value online:

* [Inclusivity](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/inclusive-speaker-orientation/)
in presentations, messaging and other communications.
* Good behavior on the Internet
([netiquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_in_technology)).
* [Open and direct](https://nohello.net) communication
[BLUF (bottom line up front)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLUF_(communication))-style.

Preferred communication method:

|                   | **Urgent**        | **Not urgent**  |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Important**     | Call or in-person | E-mail          |
| **Not important** | Instant Message   | Instant Message |

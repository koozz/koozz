	\section{Profile}
	My name is Jan, I was born in '83 and started playing around with computers
	as soon as we got an Amstrad CPC. I have been scripting ever since I was a
	little kid, this evolved into software development at a later stage.

	My professional career started in 2001 as a Webmaster, switched in 2003 to
	Network Services Administrator, switched again in 2007 to Software Developer
	where I worked on numerous JVM based projects. The most recent switch has
	been in 2020 towards the role of Site Reliability Engineer.

	At home I enjoy spending time with my wife, son and daughter, watching series
	and movies, listening to music and playing games on the computer.

	I'm a	quick learner, especially on IT matters and I'm always busy keeping my
	knowledge up-to-date, experiencing with other programming languages and
	picking up topics like Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

		convert from license plate into the model, brand and year of your car.

		\item[09/2013--08/2018] As a \textbf{Senior software engineer}, I worked on
		projects for Albert Heijn and Powerhouse and shared knowledge during our

		\item[\color{gray}08/2017--08/2018] At \textbf{Albert Heijn Labs}, I used
		the LEAN startup methodology to quickly select, test, develop and validate
		new innovations with my team of interns. We developed a chatbot that helps
		in your choice of wine, we made a realtime synchronized grocery list, we
		created a "buy button" for affiliates sites and we built an IF This Then

	\begin{cvlist}{Java developer at SDL Tridion}
		\item[09/2009--04/2011] As a \textbf{Java developer}, I was able to work in
		a product company where they applied Scrum. I started at Tridion by moving
		the whole Content Delivery codebase to Maven, hereby making it easier to
		modify or add a module to the codebase. Next, I replaced the proprietary
		logging framework with a well-known and proven third-party logging
		framework which increased performance significantly. I migrated tests from
		JUnit 3 to JUnit 4. This contributed to easy configuration of the
		Continuous Integration server and being able to show code quality metrics
		by using Sonar.

		While being the Certified Scrum Master for the Content Delivery team, I
		still contributed a lot of my time to development of the Content Delivery
		stack (transporting, deploying, storing, retrieving and rendering content).
		It was an interesting mix of challenging code (concurrency, JPA,
		transactions) and techniques (REST, OData, OAuth).
